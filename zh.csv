As skill points are acquired, equipment can become more substantial, increasing the life expectancy of each item. However, none of the equipment has an infinite life span. Maintaining proper repair and upkeep of equipment will aid in progress and likelihood of survival.
","1-4。设备具有根据其类型和目的而变化的劣化因素。时间衰退和用法在恶化的部分和地形元素中起作用。由于获得技能点，设备可能变得更加实质性，增加每个项目的预期寿命。然而，没有任何设备都有无限的寿命。保持适当的修复和维护设备将有助于进取生存的可能性和可能性。
";
"1-5. Terrain on extra solar planets can be tretcherous and must be traversed with care. Any misstep can lead to damaging your EVA suit and lead to a suit breach, which can be catastrophic. It's imparitive to explore with extreme caution.

1-6. Slope. When attempting to climb a slope be sure to look at your slope warning indicator. For slopes that are greater than 30 degrees, either at an incline or decline, poses a hazard for your traversal. Attempting to jump or run on this uneven terrain is not advised.
