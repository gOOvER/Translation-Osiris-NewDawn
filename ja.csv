10-2. Follow: Activating the Follow procedure engages the O.M.P.A. unit to trail personnel. This will keep the unit nearby to provide assistance when needed.

10-3. Flank: Activating the Flank procedure engages the O.M.P.A. unit to lead. This maneuver is ideal for guarding personnel from oncoming attacks. The O.M.P.A. is also equipped with high tech sensors that can spot danger quickly and engage the threat before it gets nearby.

10-4. Engage (Passive): If the necessary upgrades have been installed, the O.M.P.A. unit will automatically engage hostile threats to protect human personnel from injuries and prevent structural damage.

10-5. Repair: Activating the Repair procedure engages the O.M.P.A. unit to patrol a specified area and repair any owned structures that have accrued any damage.

10-6. Mine: Activating the Mine procedure engages the O.M.P.A. unit to patrol a specified area and mine any valuable resources. If the necessary upgrades have been installed, the unit will also be able to detect nearby storage units and unload the collected materials.

10-7. Summon (Experimental): Each O.M.P.A. has been equipped with a newly discovered mineral that has been found to contain manipulatable quantum properties. The material has been harnessed to allow the unit to teleport when the Summon procedure is activated. Using this feature comes at a cost, in order to provide the necessary energy to activate the reaction, a large amount of power is drained from the battery power source.","10-1.
